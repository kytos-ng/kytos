All notable changes to the kytos project will be documented in this file.

UNRELEASED - Under development
******************************

Added
=====
- Added option for links to get last TAG from ``interface.available_tags``.
- Added option for links to try to avoid a TAG value from ``interface.available_tags``.

Fixed
=====
- Execute routines like consistency checks will not trigger one more time after kytos shuts down.
- Order in ``interface.special_available_tags`` and ``interface.special_tags`` does not matter anymore when looking for used special tag.
- Exposed pymongo ``timeoutms`` via ``MONGO_OP_TIMEOUTMS`` env var, 20 seconds by default.
- Exposed pymongo ``sockettimeoutms`` via ``MONGO_SOCKET_TIMEOUTMS`` env var, 30 seconds by default
- Upgraded pymongo from 4.6.2 to 4.11.1

General Information
===================
- If you are running Linux Kernel 6.12+, you need to upgrade Elasticsearch (ES) patch version from 7.17.3 to 7.17.28

[2024.1.2] - 2024-09-16
***********************

Changed
=======
- Kytos will wait until uvicorn server starts before loading NApps.

[2024.1.1] - 2024-08-04
***********************

Added
=====
- Added logging filter to suppress frequently repeated messages from pacing.

[2024.1.0] - 2024-07-23
***********************

Added
=====
- Added in the ``pacer`` to the kytos controller. The ``pacer`` can be used by NApps to pace specific actions, at a specified ``pace`` using a specified ``strategy``. For more info see EP0038. NOTE: The only available strategy at this time is ``fixed_window``.

Changed
=======
- Updated python environment installation from 3.9 to 3.11
- MongoDB version has been updated to 7.0
- Queue buffers event handlers will now handle and log broad exceptions keeping the task execution alive
- Raised the ``api`` threadpool workers to 512.

General Information
===================
- Kytos is tested and supported with mongo version 7.0. It can work with the lower versions 6.0 and 5.0 but they are not guaranteed to work flawlessly. To update mongo version follow these `steps <https://github.com/kytos-ng/kytos/pull/470>`_.
- If you encounter problems with the http api being unavailable (return code 503), then you should boost the ``api`` threadpool size. As a general rule of thumb you should have two ``api`` threads for every three EVCs.


[2023.2.0] - 2024-02-16
***********************

Added
=====
- Added ``Interface.tag_ranges`` as ``dict[str, list[list[int]]]`` as replacement for ``vlan_pool`` settings.
- Added ``kytos/core.interface_tags`` event publication to notify any modification of ``Interface.tag_ranges`` or ``Interface.available_tags``.
- Added ``TAGRange`` class which is used when a ``UNI`` has a tag as a list of ranges.
- Added ``KytosTagError`` exception that cover other exceptions ``KytosTagtypeNotSupported``, ``KytosInvalidTagRanges``, ``KytosSetTagRangeError``, ``KytosTagsNotInTagRanges`` and ``KytosTagsAreNotAvailable`` all of which are related to TAGs.
- Added ``special_available_tags`` which stores `"untagged"` and `"any"` if they can be used from an Interface.
- Added ``maxsize_multiplier`` on ``event_buffer_conf``, which will multiply the ``maxsize`` value of the queue. By default, all KytosEventBuffer who use a bounded queue will have ``maxsize_multiplier: 2``. This default is reasonable to work out of the box with kytos-ng core NApps. But, if you have other NApps who tend to produce too many events you might want to either increase the size of the queue with and/or increase the number of max workers in the thread pool if the event handler is running on a thread pool. Typically, you'll want to first start adjusting the number of workers in the thread pool.
- Introduced a new ``meta`` on ``KytosBuffers``, which is meant for general core control events.
- Added ``api`` threadpool. This is used by the ASGI server to handle requests to non async endpoints.
- Added in configuration option ``api_concurrency_limit``, specifies the max number of concurrent API requests before rejecting the request.
- Added ``thread_pool_queue_monitors`` and ``event_buffer_monitors`` on kytos.conf. By default, it'll detect and log full queue usage over 5 secs on event thread pools and on kytos event buffers. These alerts are for providing basic visibility per second about queues usage, which these alerts you can try to understand if indeed you have way too many events or if you need to increase the number of thread pool workers depending on the scalability and workload you have.

Changed
=======
- Parametrized default ``maxTimeMS`` when creating an index via ``Mongo.boostrap_index`` via environment variable ``MONGO_IDX_TIMEOUTMS=30000``. The retries parameters reuse the same environment variables ``MONGO_AUTO_RETRY_STOP_AFTER_ATTEMPT=3``, ``MONGO_AUTO_RETRY_WAIT_RANDOM_MIN=0.1``, ``MONGO_AUTO_RETRY_WAIT_RANDOM_MAX=1`` that NApps controllers have been using.
- ``kytosd`` process will exit if a NApp raises an exception during its ``setup()`` execution.
- Change format for ``Interface.available_tags`` to ``dict[str, list[list[int]]]``. Storing ``tag_types`` as keys and a list of ranges for ``available_tags`` as values.
- ``Interface.use_tags`` and ``Interface.make_tags_available`` are compatible with list of ranges.
- ``KytosEventBuffer`'s ``put`` method  timeout now accepts a timeout argument. NApps who publish events during ``setup()`` should set ``timeout=1`` without handling the exception, so if within 1 second the event can't be put in the queue, then the NApp will fail to start, which would imply that during initialization either the queue size is too small or the NApp is misbehaving sending too many events.

Fixed
=====
- Avoid ``kytosd`` hanging its termination when handling ``SystemExit`` with SIGTERM
- Enabling an interface does not longer enables its switch

Deprecated
==========
- Deleted ``vlan_pool`` from ``kytos.conf`` in favor of ``Interface.tag_ranges`` which updates from ``kytos/topology`` API endpoint, ``v3/interfaces/{intf_id}/tag_ranges``.

General Information
===================
- ``kytos.conf.template`` has changed you might want to regenerate ``kytos.conf`` if you want to set non default values


[2023.1.0] - 2023-06-05
***********************

Added
=====
- Added ``status`` to ``as_dict()`` from entities ``Interface``, ``Switch`` and ``Link``.
- Added ``@validate_openapi`` decorator to validate OpenAPI routes
- Added ``avalidate_openapi_request(spec, request)`` to validate OpenAPI ``async`` routes
- ``htppx`` is now shipped as a dependency, NApps can also leverage it instead of ``requests``
- Added ``kytos.core.rest_api`` module exposing utilities for requests handlers
- Added new kytos.conf option ``api_traceback_on_500``, which is True by default to provide a complete traceback on API responses if an internal server error ever happens
- Added ``status_reason`` to ``Interface``, ``Switch``, and ``Link``.
- Added ``register_status_reason_func`` to ``Interface``, ``Switch``, and ``Link``.

Changed
=======
- Changed ``UNI.is_valid`` to allow tags such as ``any`` and ``untagged``
- Changed ``EntityStatus`` value from 1, 2 and 3 to ``UP``, ``DISABLED`` and ``DOWN`` respectively.
- Replaced ``werkzeug/flask`` with ``starlette/uvicorn``
- Updated logging.ini ``logger_api_server`` with ``level: INFO`` by default
- Updated APM to instrument ``starlette``
- HTTP API exceptions responses no longer include the ``"name"`` key name in the response, only ``"code"``  and ``"description"`` still remain
- Development ``get_test_client`` now uses a ``htppx.AsyncClient`` instance
- Moved ``error_msg()`` to ``kytos.core.rest_api`` so it can be used in any NApp
- ``Link`` now includes its ``id`` on its string format representation to facilitate correlating events in the logs
- ``Link`` now have ordered endpoints. They are ordere by its ``id``
- Updated ``status_api`` to include when the APIServer started and how much time has elapsed.
- Augmented ``listen_to`` decorator ``pool`` kwarg to support ``'dynamic_single'``. In this mode, each decorated handler will be associated with an exclusive ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` with a single worker, ensuring FIFO event processing, which can be suitable for non IO-bound handlers.

Fixed
=====
- Unexposed ``jwt_secret`` on ``GET /api/kytos/core/config/`` endpoint


[2022.3.1]  2023-02-17
**********************

Fixed
=====
- handled ``PackException`` to avoid crashing ``msg_out_event_handler`` coroutine


[2022.3.0]  2022-12-15
**********************

Changed
=======

- Upstream core dependencies have been upgraded: ``ipython==8.1.1, flask-socketio==5.2.0, flask_cors==3.0.10, flask[async]==2.1.3, janus==1.0.0, jinja2==3.1.2, watchdog==2.1.9, pyjwt==2.4.0, pylint==2.15.0``
- Flask/Werkzeug 2.0.0+ now provide ``async`` support, so NApps can leverage ``asyncio`` and its ecosystem when applicable using the same ``rest`` decorator
- Replaced ``get_event_loop`` with ``get_running_loop`` when applicable to be compatible with python 3.9+ in the future
- NApps are unloaded in the reverse order that they are enabled to facilitate to shutdown gracefully.
- ``MongoClient`` now has an explicit ``write_concern`` majority
- Added dependencies ``dnspython==2.2.1, email-validator==1.3.0``
- Auth storage has been migrated from the NApp ``storehouse`` to MongoDB with ``kytos/users.py`` collection
- ``status_funcs`` have been moved to ``GenericEntity`` sub classes to avoid potential conflicts with different entities

Fixed
=====
- Log traceback error if NApps execute method doesn't handle an exception
- Stop ``APIServer`` instance after unloading NApps
- Log traceback error if the header from authorization was empty resulting in ``HTTP 500``

********************************

Fixed
=====
- Added connection_timeout as a default on KytosConfig to support older configuration files


[2022.2.1] - "kiko" - 2022-08-19
********************************

Fixed
=====
- Added sanity safe guard on ``Interface.make_tag_available`` method


[2022.2.0] - "kiko" - 2022-08-09

*********************************

Added
=====
- Added configuration option ``connection_timeout = 130`` for switch connection.


[2022.2rc2] - "kiko" - 2022-08-04
*********************************

Added
=====
- Added configuration option ``logger_decorators``. Allows for decorating the Logger class with 0 or more decorators. Decorators are applied in order provided.
- Added ``kytos.core.logger_decorators.queue_decorator``. This decorator adds an internal queue for handling log messages. This decorator is intended to reduce latency associated with logging calls by offloading required IO operations to a separate thread.
- Added ``kytos.core.logger_decorators.apm_decorator``. This decorator instruments various logging methods in order to measure performance, and reports the results to the apm backend.

Changed
=======
- Loggers are now by default decorated with ``kytos.core.logger_decorators.queue_decorator``. Usage of this decorator has been observed to significantly reduce logging latency, with one scenario showing an improvement from 19.65ms average latency down to 0.55ms average latency.

[2022.2rc1] - "kiko" - 2022-07-25
*********************************

Added
=====
- Unhandled exception on a ``listen_to`` decorated function (running in a ThreadPool) is logged as error.
- New ``--database`` configuration option that supports ``mongodb``
- MongoDB client for NApps, ``Mongo`` available on ``kytos.core.db`` module

- ``pymongo`` and ``pydantic`` (for database models) are now core dependencies
- Added MongoDB environment variables ``MONGO_HOST_SEEDS, MONGO_USERNAME, MONGO_PASSWORD``
- Added optional MongoDB environment ``MONGO_DBNAME, MONGO_MAX_POOLSIZE, MONGO_MIN_POOLSIZE, MONGO_TIMEOUTMS``
- Added a docker-compose.yml file for local development to compose with MongoDB replica set cluster
- Added an in-memory dead letter structure for unhandled exceptions of KytosEvents indexed by their names
- Added core endpoints for the dead letter structure:

  .. code:: console

   GET /api/kytos/core/dead_letter/?event_name=<name>
   PATCH /api/kytos/core/dead_letter/ (requires request body)
   DELETE /api/kytos/core/dead_letter/ (requires request body)

- Added ``tenacity`` as a core dependency for retries.
- New ``--apm`` configuration option that supports ``elasticsearch`` APM (Application Performance Monitoring)
- ``kytosd`` Elastic APM integration provides instrumentation for MongoDB, Flask, requests and ``KytosEvent``
- ``@begin_span`` decorator for on-demand APM custom functions/methods instrumentation
- Augmented docker-compose.yml to also spin up Elastsearch, Kibana and APM server with authentication
- Augmented docker-compose to also spin up Filebeat, integrating log file as input
- The ``listen_to`` decorator now supports a ``pool`` keyword argument to specify which thread pool the execution should be submitted
- New core ``kytos.core.retry`` module provides decorators for retries based on ``tenacity``
- Added ``@alisten_to`` decorator for ``async`` methods. NApps can subscribe to events asynchronously with this decorator as needed.
- Unhandled exceptions on ``@listen_to`` and ``@alisten_to`` decorators now also include a traceback
- Added ``status_funcs`` on ``GenericEntity`` to allow NApps to register functions to compose ``status``.

Changed
=======
- Kytos controller can shutdown if the database is configured but not reachable during startup time.
- Augmented ``KytosEvent`` with internal attributes (``id`` and ``reinjections``), no breaking changes.
- ``KytosEvent`` now optionally supports a ``trace_parent`` argument for APM distributed tracing to also instrument and correlate ``KytosEvent``.
- Added file formatter and file handler boilerplate on logging.ini.template to facilitate hooking the file handler on logger_root and logger_kytos as needed.
- Broke compatibility in the ``thread_pool_max_workers``, it uses a dict now instead of a single integer. If you were using a single integer for a global pool, please migrate it to ``{"sb": 256, "db": 256, "app": x}``, where x should be the value that you used to use or the default 512.
- The following pools are available by default to be used in the listen_to decorator with the ``pool`` option:

  .. code-block:: console

   sb: it's used automatically by kytos/of_core.* events, it's meant for southbound related messages
   app: it's meant for general NApps event, it's default pool if no other one has been specified
   db: it can be used by for higher priority db related tasks (need to be parametrized on decorator), it's also used automatically by kytos.storehouse.* events

- ``msg_out`` core queue now leverages a PriorityQueue instead of a FIFO Queue.
- ``msg_in`` core queue now leverages a PriorityQueue instead of a FIFO Queue.
- ``kytos.core.log`` now directly provides the appropriate logger to the NAPP, rather than a facade
- Flask will encode datetime objects format as ``%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S`` str

Fixed
=====
- Fixed file already exists error when creating config dirs, issue 222
